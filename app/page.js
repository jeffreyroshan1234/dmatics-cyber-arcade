// The arcade UI (all three games, music, animated backgrounds, review) is a
// self-contained, offline-capable document in /public/game.html. We mount it
// full-bleed. Because it is served over http(s) and same-origin with the API
// routes, its leaderboard auto-syncs to the shared server board via /api/scores.
// Opened as a local file it falls back to on-device localStorage — so the exact
// same file works online AND offline at the booth.

// Cache-busting: iframes are cached hard by browsers, so a new deploy can keep
// showing the previous build. Stamping the commit SHA (or the build time as a
// fallback) into the URL guarantees every deploy serves a fresh document.
